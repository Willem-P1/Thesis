# Thesis
Repo for thesis, making upper bound heuristic for calculating TBR distance

#How to use
To use the code compile the java files in the "code" folder using "javac code/*.java". Then to run the code, use "java code.Main" with some command line arguments:
use -p to pass the file with the trees to run the algorithms on
use -t to pass the timelimit, what this timelimit means depends on which algorithm is used
